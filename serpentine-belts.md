## Maintaining Serpentine Belts: Tips from the Experts**

Proper maintenance of your customer's serpentine belt can extend its lifespan and keep their vehicle running smoothly:

- Regular Inspection: Check the belt for signs of wear, cracks, or fraying. If they notice any issues, it's time for a replacement.
- Tension Check: Proper belt tension is crucial. Too loose, and it can slip; too tight, and it can strain the components. A mechanic can check you belt to ensure it has the right tension.
- Replacement Schedule: While belts can last for tens of thousands of kms, they do wear out over time. Encourage your customers to have their belts checked during their scheduled vehicle service.
