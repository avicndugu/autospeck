## What is a Fan Belt?

A fan belt, also commonly known as a drive belt, is a crucial component within a vehicle's engine system. Its primary function is to drive various auxiliary components, such as the alternator, water pump, power steering pump, and most notably, the engine cooling fan.

Fan belts are a staple in the automotive and agricultural industry, known for their versatility and reliable power transmission capabilities. At Autospeck, we offer fan belts in various sizes and series to cater to different vehicles and machines:

### 1. Plain Fan Belts

- **9.5 Series:** These fan belts are a popular choice for smaller engines and machinery. Designed for compact applications, the 9.5 series fan belts provide efficient power transmission while minimizing space requirements.
- **A Series:** The A series fan belts are widely used across a range of vehicles and equipment. With excellent flexibility and high efficiency, these belts are suitable for various demanding applications.
- **B Series:** When it comes to heavy-duty applications, the B series fan belts are the go-to choice. Their robust construction and dependable performance make them a favorite for larger vehicles and machinery.

- **9.5 Series:** These cogged fan belts are perfect for compact applications where space is limited. The notched design enhances flexibility and helps prevent heat-related issues.
- **AX Series:** Cogged fan belts in the A series are optimized for performance and durability. Their notched structure ensures smoother operation and extended service life.
